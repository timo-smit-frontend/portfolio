    description: `<p>My expertise in accessibility was solidified through a dedicated project for the <strong>Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal</strong>, where I served as an <strong>Accessibility Expert / Developer / Consultant</strong>. I researched <strong>WCAG guidelines</strong>, created a comprehensive accessibility improvement plan, and implemented changes in a modern front-end stack using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>. This project allowed me to bridge my creative background with technical execution, making a tangible impact on a high-profile digital platform.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I contributed to accessibility efforts at <strong>UBO Agency</strong>, acting as the switch between developers and designers to ensure inclusive digital experiences. My foundational knowledge was built during my studies in <strong>Communication and Multimedia Design</strong> and further strengthened by certifications such as <strong>Creating Accessible Websites</strong> (Udemy) and <strong>WAI0.1x: Introduction to Web Accessibility</strong> (edX).</p>`,

    description: `<p>To deepen my front-end development skills, I completed the <strong>React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)</strong> course on Udemy. I then applied this knowledge by building my personal portfolio with <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>, focusing on performance, accessibility, and a user-friendly interface.</p>
      <p>My React expertise was further developed through real-world projects, such as optimizing the digital platform for <strong>Project Enhance</strong> (Capgemini & United Nations World Food Programme), where I enhanced performance and usability for a global audience. At <strong>Accent Interactive</strong>, I fully developed the frontend for a new version of the PlanAhead planning system, connecting user-centered design with technical implementation using modern frameworks.</p>
      <p>These experiences have equipped me to tackle complex web development challenges and deliver high-quality, accessible solutions.</p>`,
