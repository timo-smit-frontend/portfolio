    description: `<p>My expertise in accessibility was solidified through a dedicated project for the <strong>Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal</strong>, where I served as an <strong>Accessibility Expert / Developer / Consultant</strong>. I researched <strong>WCAG guidelines</strong>, created a comprehensive accessibility improvement plan, and implemented changes in a modern front-end stack using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>. This project allowed me to bridge my creative background with technical execution, making a tangible impact on a high-profile digital platform.</p>
      <p>Additionally, I contributed to accessibility efforts at <strong>UBO Agency</strong>, acting as the switch between developers and designers to ensure inclusive digital experiences. My foundational knowledge was built during my studies in <strong>Communication and Multimedia Design</strong> and further strengthened by certifications such as <strong>Creating Accessible Websites</strong> (Udemy) and <strong>WAI0.1x: Introduction to Web Accessibility</strong> (edX).</p>`,
